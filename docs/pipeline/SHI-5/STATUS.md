## Next action
Run business-analyst on SHI-5: write `requirements.md` and create the `eng` tickets from the three
story tickets. Carry through the three points in the product-owner handoff comment — name the exact
`gate.sh` before/after conditions (so the owner approves a specific diff, Q-2), make backwards
compatibility for existing installs a release-blocking acceptance criterion (BR-5), and keep every
capability fail-closed (BR-8).

## Waiting on the owner
- nothing currently open. Q-1 and Q-2 answered 2026-09-18 (see clarifications.md): SHI-5 runs under
  the new rules (marketing capability off during build); gate.sh condition-change approval is
  deferred until the BA writes the exact before/after list into requirements.md — bring it back to
  the owner before stage 5 (build) starts.

Previously raised, now closed:
- `scripts/pipeline/hooks/allow-paths.sh` Windows backslash path bug — **fixed and verified** in
  d4f9b21.
- `docs/pipeline/_templates/research.md` placeholder text from an unrelated product — tracked as
  **SHI-10** (follow-up, out of scope for SHI-5).

## Workspace note
Ship Pipeline Linear workspace was empty of Stage/Owner labels; created the two label groups
this session. Linear rejects duplicate names across groups, so the Owner-group roles that
collided with Stage names are: `qa-tester` (not `qa`) and `the-owner` (not `owner`, which also
collides with the group's own name). Use these exact names for this workspace going forward.
There is no `Kind` label group in this workspace: a child ticket's kind is recorded in its
description and in `tickets.md`, which is what the gates read.

## Open defect tickets
- none
