## Next action
Stage 6 (dev): `bash scripts/pipeline/promote.sh SHI-5 dev` merges the branch into `master`. Ask the
owner before running it — it changes `master` for everyone. `gate.sh SHI-5 dev` already PASSes under
the new rules (marketing=off, deploy-envs=off). With deploy-envs off, promote.sh skips the deploy
wait/dispatch/smoke; the dev self-check is then done against the master ref (DEV_URL), per CONTEXT.md.

## Waiting on the owner
- Nothing blocking. Two things to decide by go-live (also in impl-notes.md, Known limitations):
  1. Version: `next-version.sh` will propose `v0.1.0` because this repo has no git tags. Tag the released
     v1.0.0 first, or answer "go as v1.1.0". `plugin.json` is already 1.1.0.
  2. `plugin.json` has no `commands`/`agents` keys; the build agent weakened `test_config.sh`'s
     assertion to match. Confirm that is intended.
  Follow-up candidate: this repo's `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will fail on pushes/tags (no Dockerfile).

Closed:
- Q-1 answered 2026-09-18 — SHI-5 runs under the new rules; this repo's marketing capability is
  flipped off during the build (SHI-20), before stage 6.
- Q-2 answered 2026-09-18 — process answer only ("bring the specific list back"); the list is now in
  requirements.md §4 and the approval itself was Q-3.
- Q-3 answered 2026-09-18 — **approved as written**. `gate.sh`'s production-stage marketing
  requirement gains one conjunct (`&& [ "$has_marketing" = yes ]`); nothing else in `gate.sh` changes.
  SHI-14 (and downstream SHI-15/19/20) unblocked.

Previously raised, now closed:
- `scripts/pipeline/hooks/allow-paths.sh` Windows backslash path bug — **fixed and verified** in
  d4f9b21.
- `docs/pipeline/_templates/research.md` placeholder text from an unrelated product — tracked as
  **SHI-10** (follow-up, out of scope for SHI-5).

## Workspace note
Ship Pipeline Linear workspace was empty of Stage/Owner labels; created the two label groups
this session. Linear rejects duplicate names across groups, so the Owner-group roles that
collided with Stage names are: `qa-tester` (not `qa`) and `the-owner` (not `owner`, which also
collides with the group's own name). Use these exact names for this workspace going forward.
There is no `Kind` label group in this workspace: a child ticket's kind is recorded in its
description and in `tickets.md`, which is what the gates read.

## Open defect tickets
- none
